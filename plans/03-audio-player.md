# Plan 03 — Audio Player

## Goal

Implement `AudioPlayer` in `audio.py`: a `sounddevice`-based PCM consumer that opens an output stream on the first chunk and drains cleanly when synthesis ends.

## Reference

See `specs/audio-player.md` for the interface, audio format, and implementation notes.

## Audio format

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Encoding | Signed 16-bit PCM, little-endian (`dtype='int16'`) |
| Sample rate | 44100 Hz |
| Channels | 1 (mono) |

## Tasks

### `audio.py`

- [ ] Implement `AudioPlayer.__init__(device=None)`: store device, do not open stream yet
- [ ] Implement `AudioPlayer.feed(chunk: bytes) -> None`:
  - Open `sounddevice.OutputStream(samplerate=44100, channels=1, dtype='int16', device=device)` on first call
  - Convert `chunk` bytes to `numpy.ndarray` of `int16` via `numpy.frombuffer`
  - Write array to the stream (blocking write via `stream.write()`)
  - Wrap blocking write in `asyncio.to_thread` if called from async context — note: `feed` is a sync method called from the module callback; the stream write itself is blocking and acceptable here since it is fast (just fills a buffer)
- [ ] Implement `AudioPlayer.drain() -> None`:
  - If stream is open: call `stream.stop()` then `stream.close()`
  - Reset internal stream reference to `None`

### Tests (`tests/test_audio.py`)

- [ ] `feed()` opens the stream on first call and does not open it again on subsequent calls
- [ ] `drain()` closes the stream; calling `drain()` twice does not raise
- [ ] `drain()` before any `feed()` does not raise
- [ ] `feed()` with empty bytes does not raise and does not open the stream

### Note on testing

`sounddevice` interacts with real hardware. In unit tests, mock `sounddevice.OutputStream` to avoid requiring an audio device. Use `pytest-mock` (`mocker.patch`).
