        Synthesize `text` and call `callback` with each PCM chunk as it arrives.

        - `text`: the string to synthesize. Must not be empty.
        - `options`: per-call overrides (voice, etc.). Module uses config defaults for None fields.
        - `callback`: called once per audio chunk with raw bytes. May be called from any thread.

        Raises `TTSError` on synthesis failure.
        Returns only after all chunks have been passed to `callback`.
